GO-PLAYER
=========

a web-based html5 music player

go-player serves the all files in the music directory. It's not recommended to use it outside
your local network because there is currently no security and authentication implemented.

build
--------

use http://gobuild.io/ to build the server for your plattform.

creat a directory for the player...lets call it go-player on your machine and put the built file in this folder.
copy the 'index.html' file and the complete 'assets' folder to this directory.
In this dir. you have to create a subdirectory called music (go-player/music), in this directory you can put your complete music.

Now run the application, maybe (on Windows) "go-player.exe", and move to your browser and visit localhost:8080, then listen to your music
